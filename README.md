![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ce1f7a3-41cf-47b8-98b3-161683b1b749)

This project implements an Enhanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to predict pharmacokinetic (PK) properties such as Volume of Distribution (VDss) and Clearance (CL) of chemical compounds. Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, this framework is optimized for high accuracy in predicting these critical drug characteristics.
